# Tip Calculator

This project is part of an open mentoring program ran by [Leonard Tatum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonard-tatum-768850105/). 
In this program various mobile applications are created and published in 24 hours. All participants receive
developer credit in the opening splash screen of the app.

This mentoring program is completely free, remote, and any individual can participate. The program runs on Saturday
mornings. We meet for 6 Saturdays, 4 hours each day. All levels of skill are welcomed. Checkout just a
few of the applications we have created.

## Introduction

This is the world's most beautiful tip calculator. The application has everything you need for 
calculating and splitting tips. You can round off values, see how much each individual has to pay,
customize settings, tip history to track how much you are tipping and where, tipping guide for
other countries around the world, and more! Everything is free to use, no gimmicks. No obstructive
ads, no in-app purchases, no pay-to-play monetization models. Everything is completely free. 

This project was not created to earn money, it was created to help spread the love of Android
development. And change the lives of individuals involved. People who join Leonard Tatum's mentoring 
program often times are looking for a new career; a fresh start at life. This is their opportunity
to build up a development portfolio. Often times, the requirement to get through the doors of a tech
company as an entry level developer is a minimum of three published apps. Projects like this help
build the necessary coding requirements to start a new career. You can help support these
individuals by just downloading and sharing the app.
